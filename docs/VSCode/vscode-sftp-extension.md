# VS Code SFTP Extension

VS Code SFTP extension can be used to directly edit files on remote unix server.

This is useful, in cases, where we can't install VS Code. We then access remote servers using local (windows) installation of VS Code without setting up anything on remote machine.

## Install and configure VSCode SFTP extension

- On VS Code, search for `VS Code SFTP` extension and install.
- On command pallete, seacrh for `SFTP: Open folder`.
- Click on `Add new SFTP Configuration`.
- Add connection details for remote unix server in config file.
- Select the folder to open.
- You are done. You can now directly edit files on remote machine.

This extension can also be used to download a folder locally.
