Ansible is a simple automation tool that can fit into existing infrastucture, without any major changes.

Please visit Ansible Overview [here](https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works) for more details.

There is also a [Github Repo](https://github.com/kathuriaas/ansible-examples.git) which has multiple examples of Ansible.
